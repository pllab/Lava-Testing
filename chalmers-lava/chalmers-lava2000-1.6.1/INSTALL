# Installation

First install the [Haskell Platform](http://www.haskell.org/platform).

Then install the package by running

    cabal install

from within this directory. Alternatively, run

    cabal install chalmers-lava2000

to install the latest version on Hackage.

# Verification

In order to use verification, make sure that the binaries `smv` and/or `minisat` are visible in your path.

  * SMV can be obtained from here: <http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~modelcheck/smv.html>
  * MiniSAT can be obtained from here: <http://minisat.se/MiniSat.html>
      - (We have tested with the pre-compiled Linux version 1.14.)

If verification gives ".../smv.wrapper Permission denied" (or similarly for `minisat`), you need to mark the problematic files as executable. (That is, not the files in the `Scripts` directory, but the copy of those files that Cabal made during installation.
